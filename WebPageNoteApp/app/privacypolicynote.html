   <!--It's a good idea to provide an RSS feed of privacy policy updates so that users don't have to keep checking back to see if anything has changed. Especially if your feed doesn't change regularly, it doesn't take much work to update it by hand whenever you make a change. Of course, whenever you make a large change, it's still a good idea to push a notice out to your users, even if you do have an RSS feed. Make sure to remove the RSS section below if you don't use an update feed.-->

     <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them 
        carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify 
        the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt 
        to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to 
        translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. 
        The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, 
        and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to CyberXArea.<br>
     <p>CyberXArea is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without 
        making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.<br>The Note App app stores 
        and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. 
        It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore 
        recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
         software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. 
         It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, 
         compromise your phone’s security features 
        and it could mean that the Note App app won’t work properly or at all. </p>
        The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

            <ul>
             <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Play Services</a></li>
             </ul>

     
     <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that CyberXArea 
        will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will
         require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection 
         can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but CyberXArea 
         cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality 
        if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
         have any of your data allowance left.</p>


      <p><p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the
        terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result,
         you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the 
         connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re
          accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use 
          the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data 
          roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please 
          be aware that we assume that you
        have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p></p>

        <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – 
            the requirements for the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend 
            the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates
             if you want to keep using the app. CyberXArea does not promise that it will always 
             update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version 
             that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates
              to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, 
              and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. 
              Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
               to you in these terms will end; 
            (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>


            <h1>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p>I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

                These terms and conditions are effective as of 2023-02-06</p>
