   <!--It's a good idea to provide an RSS feed of privacy policy updates so that users don't have to keep checking back to see if anything has changed. Especially if your feed doesn't change regularly, it doesn't take much work to update it by hand whenever you make a change. Of course, whenever you make a large change, it's still a good idea to push a notice out to your users, even if you do have an RSS feed. Make sure to remove the RSS section below if you don't use an update feed.-->

     <h1> Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        CyberXArea built the Quizzzy Trivia app as an Ad Supported app.
         This SERVICE is provided by CyberXArea at no cost and is intended for use as is.<br>
     <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, 
        and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.<br>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and
        use of information in relation to this policy. </p>
             The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. <br>
             I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
            The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, 
            which are accessible at Quizzzy Trivia unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p><br>
       
        
            <ul>
             <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Play Services</a></li>
             </ul>

     <h1>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h1>        
     <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus,
        you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
        I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
        This policy is effective as of 2022-07-30</p>

      <h1>Children’s Privacy</h1>
      <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.<br>
        I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.<br>
        In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information.<br>
        I immediately delete this from our servers.<br> If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware 
        that your child has provided us with personal information, <br>
        please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.<br>
      
        Along the same lines, CyberXArea cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e.<br>
        You need to make sure that your device stays charged – <br>if it runs out of battery and you can’t 
        turn it on to avail the Service, CyberXArea cannot accept responsibility.<br>

        With respect to CyberXArea’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, 
        it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct 
        at all times.<br> We do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available
         to you.<br> CyberXArea accepts no liability for any loss, 
        direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
